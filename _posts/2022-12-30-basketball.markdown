I was introduced to basketball at the young age of 12 years. But, during childhood, it got lost in a mix of all other games and sports, especially because of cricket. If you are a little familiar with India, you might have heard the word Cricket. In India, for some people, it is a kind of religion. Anyways, I was also mesmerized by the sport until my college life. When I reach IIT Kanpur for my undergraduate studies. I was again introduced to the basketball, and it was different this time. I became a part of the basketball team and started working hard to improve my game.
