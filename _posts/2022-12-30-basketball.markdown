I was introduced to basketball at a young age of 12 years. But,  during childhood it got lost in mixer of all other games and sports, especially because of cricket. If you are little familiar with India, you might have heard the word Cricket. In India, for some people it is a kind of a religion. Anyways, I was also mesmerized or may be addicted with that sport until my college life. When I reach IIT Kanpur for my undergraduate studies. I was again introduced with the basketball, and it was different this time. I became a part of basketball team and started working hard to improve my game.
