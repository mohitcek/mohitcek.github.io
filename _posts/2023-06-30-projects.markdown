# Johns Hopkins University

## UQpy – Python toolbox
(Jan 2018 – Present)
- UQpy (Uncertainty Quantification with Python) is a general-purpose Python toolbox for modeling uncertainty in physical and mathematical systems
- Developed modules with various methods for sampling techniques, surrogate modeling, and sensitivity analysis
- Sequential learning algorithms based on the surrogate modeling are computationally more efficient for complex models, ran these models on Maryland Advanced Research Computing Center (MARCC) server using UQpy tools
- UQpy provides tools such as Refined Stratified Sampling (RSS), Gradient Enhanced-RSS (GE-RSS) and Adaptive Kriging – Monte Carlo Simulation (AKMCS) for sequential learning algorithm

## Large Scale Boundary Layer Wind Tunnel (BLWT) Experiments
(Jan 2020 – Present)
- Developed a semi-automated framework to conduct high-volume through-put experiments using a wind tunnel facility at the University of Florida
- A machine learning based framework sequentially guides the experiments by selecting the next roughness terrain
- Framework has been explored with various active learning functions to identify different roughness terrains which generate wind profile with similar second-order properties
- Various learning functions have been applied to large-scale experimental models to improve surrogate fit and sensitivity analysis has been done based on Sobol Indices.

## Adaptive Surrogate Model Construction for Efficient Global Sensitivity Analysis
(July 2021 – Dec 2022)
- Developing an algorithm to tackle the Sensitivity Analysis in case of computationally expensive models by utilizing the characteristics of surrogates and Sobol Indices
- A proposed active learning function adaptively learns new samples based on complete available data and reduces the uncertainty in Sobol Indices

## Study on Effects of Imperfections in Ship Grillage Structure using FEM model
(Dec 2019 – Dec 2020)
- The main aim is to study the behavior of ship grillage in the nonlinear region due to different types of imperfections (plate, web, and flange imperfections)
- Redundant imperfections can be identified, using adaptive Sensitivity Analysis, and removed to improve the model
- GE-RSS method can reduce the uncertainty(variance) in the ultimate strength or other quantity of interest by adaptively learning samples using gradient estimates

## Gradient Enhanced-Refined Stratified Sampling using Voronoi Stratification
(Aug 2018 – May 2019)
- Developed an efficient learning algorithm to extend the existing GE-RSS method in the case of Voronoi stratification
- The algorithm aims to adaptively generate new samples to reduce the (uncertainty) output variance
- The critical aspect is to approximately compute the gradient at the centroid of each Voronoi cell using a surrogate model and use it to identify the contribution of each cell to the output variance

# Indian Institute of Technology Kanpur (IITK)

## Master's Thesis: Physical Parameter Estimation of Non-Classical Damped System from Spatially Incomplete Mode Parameters 	
(May 2016 – Apr 2017)
- Identified physical parameters of non-classically damped spring-mass systems using test vibration data, which would provide a better estimate of the system’s performance under dynamic loading 
- Identification of mode shapes in different cases of non-classically damped system with incomplete instrumentation, i.e. when not all DOFs of the system are excited or observed
- Established the minimum instrumentation necessary for identifying the complete set of physical parameters
- The proposed method identifies exact physical parameters for noise-free spatially incomplete modal parameters and has acceptable errors when data is corrupted by noise.

## Finite Element Analysis of Concrete Wall 
(Mar 2016 – Apr 2016)
- Applied the basic concepts of FEMA to understand the behavior of concrete wall under in-plane loading
- Used a FEMA software ABAQUS to model concrete wall with different shapes of opening. Further, observed the behavior of shape of openings on concrete walls under in-plane loading
- Discussed about the failure mode and maximum stress developed in case of different openings

## Vibration Controlling Dampers 
(Mar 2016 – Apr 2016)
- Studied about the different types of dampers and their need to dissipate seismic energy to reduce damages
- Modeled different types of dampers - Friction, Viscous and Steel dampers for analysis of shear type buildings
- Discussed about various limitations in modeling of above-mentioned types of dampers

## Mortar-less Masonry and Interlocking Blocks 
(Mar 2015 – Apr 2015)
- Studied the disadvantages of conventional masonry and need for alternate construction method such as mortar less masonry
- Investigated about the performance of constructed dry stack masonry walls under axial, shear and flexural loading
- Modes of failure of masonry walls were also observed for different type of loadings

## Control establishment and Mapping using GPS and Total Station 
(Oct 2014 – Nov 2014)
- Worked with a team of 6 member handled various instruments such as Total station, Levelling, GPS
- Created a UDS program to store relative/local coordinates of almost 470 point, which represents land feature in academic area
- Corrected elevation using Levelling from a Bench Mark and coordinates of control points was measured again using GPS
- Multi-date data was aggregated into suitable files and imported into QGIS software to create a topographical map

## Design Project – Industrial Building	
(Oct 2014 – Nov 2014)
- Worked in a team of 6 students, performing a structural analysis of the given building for different load cases.
- Designed elements of industrial building like top and bottom chord, crane girder, base plate & connections.
- Taking due notice of the economic feasibility and constraints, checked the structure’s engineering aspects like bending moment, flexural, torsional and web buckling using IS800 codes.
