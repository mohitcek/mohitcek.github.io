# Master's Thesis: Physical Parameter Estimation of Non-Classical Damped System from Spatially Incomplete Mode Parameters 	
(May 2016 – Apr 2017)
- Identified physical parameters of non-classically damped spring-mass systems using test vibration data, which would provide a better estimate of the system’s performance under dynamic loading 
- Identification of mode shapes in different cases of non-classically damped system with incomplete instrumentation, i.e. when not all DOFs of the system are excited or observed
- Established the minimum instrumentation necessary for identifying the complete set of physical parameters
- The proposed method identifies exact physical parameters for noise-free spatially incomplete modal parameters and has acceptable errors when data is corrupted by noise.


# Finite Element Analysis of Concrete Wall 
(Mar 2016 – Apr 2016)
- Applied the basic concepts of FEMA to understand the behavior of concrete wall under in-plane loading
- Used a FEMA software ABAQUS to model concrete wall with different shapes of opening. Further, observed the behavior of shape of openings on concrete walls under in-plane loading
- Discussed about the failure mode and maximum stress developed in case of different openings

# Vibration Controlling Dampers 
(Mar 2016 – Apr 2016)
- Studied about the different types of dampers and their need to dissipate seismic energy to reduce damages
- Modeled different types of dampers - Friction, Viscous and Steel dampers for analysis of shear type buildings
- Discussed about various limitations in modeling of above-mentioned types of dampers

# Mortar-less Masonry and Interlocking Blocks 
(Mar 2015 – Apr 2015)
- Studied the disadvantages of conventional masonry and need for alternate construction method such as mortar less masonry
- Investigated about the performance of constructed dry stack masonry walls under axial, shear and flexural loading
- Modes of failure of masonry walls were also observed for different type of loadings

# Control establishment and Mapping using GPS and Total Station 
(Oct 2014 – Nov 2014)
- Worked with a team of 6 member handled various instruments such as Total station, Levelling, GPS
- Created a UDS program to store relative/local coordinates of almost 470 point, which represents land feature in academic area
- Corrected elevation using Levelling from a Bench Mark and coordinates of control points was measured again using GPS
- Multi-date data was aggregated into suitable files and imported into QGIS software to create a topographical map

# Design Project – Industrial Building	
(Oct 2014 – Nov 2014)
- Worked in a team of 6 students, performing a structural analysis of the given building for different load cases.
- Designed elements of industrial building like top and bottom chord, crane girder, base plate & connections.
- Taking due notice of the economic feasibility and constraints, checked the structure’s engineering aspects like bending moment, flexural, torsional and web buckling using IS800 codes.
