My intension for this webpage is simple and straightforward. I wish to share my academic 
life as a fresher (at IITK) to a graduate student (at JHU). I started this journey almost 
10 years ago (in 2012) and I have been fortunate enough to be part of delightful projects and clubs at 
both the university. Here, you can get a glimpse of different projects and academic programs 
that I have completed. I have shared a brief summary of my personal life, feel free to check 
that out at the _Academic Life_ page. Further, I have shared different posts that shares different 
aspects of my life.

at Hopkins and IIT, Kanpur. The second post talks about all the academic projects at Johns Hopkins University.
