# Indian Institute of Technology

If you are acquainted with the competitive entrance exams for top engineering colleges in India, you may already be familiar with the esteemed institutions known as the "IITs." These universities hold a prestigious status in India and offer high-quality education across various engineering disciplines.

I dedicated two years of my life to preparing for the IIT-JEE examination. Subsequently, in 2012, I joined the Civil Engineering department at IIT Kanpur. My initial year at IITK proved to be incredibly captivating as I delved into a multitude of new activities. It was during this time that I discovered a whole new world beyond equations and theories. I came across numerous clubs and organizations, including Rubik's Cube, Films Club, and Media and Publicity Team, among others. My experience at IITK was truly remarkable, and I find myself yearning to revisit that basketball court and relive those fond memories.


# Johns Hopkins University

I came to Baltimore, US in August 2017. This was the first time; I ever came outside India. I was feeling excited 
as well as nervous about the new country/opportunity. But, I was fortunate enough to make amazing friends and explore 
the city of Baltimore. Life as a graduate student at Hopkins was going well until Feb 2020, as the pandemic hits everyone 
and everything comes to a halt. But, now after a few years, I am looking to complete my Ph.D. and looking forward to new 
opportunities in life.

My primary research revolves around the development of active learning algorithms for global sensitivity analysis and their application in large-scale physical experiments. Collaborating with a team from Johns Hopkins University (JHU) and the University of Florida (UF), we have successfully implemented an active learning framework that is rarely explored in the field. This framework automates and guides wind tunnel experiments, leveraging an iterative learning algorithm. The algorithm accesses real-time experimental data, preprocesses it, retrains the model, and provides suggestions for the next experiment. By employing Active Learning (AL), a subset of machine learning algorithms, I have effectively guided research on Boundary Layer wind flow in wind tunnel studies.
