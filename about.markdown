# Indian Institute of Technology

If you are familiar with competitive examination to enter top level engineering colleges in India, 
you might have heard the name "IITs". IIT's are prestigious university in India, which provide high 
level education in various engineering fields.

I invested two years of my life, to prepare for IIT-JEE examination. Then, I joined the Civil Engineering 
department at IIT Kanpur in 2012. My first year at IITK was very interesting, I learned about various new 
activities, and somehow, I lost in a new world, which includes more than equations and theories. I came 
across various club such as Rubik's cube, Drama club, Films club, Baja, Entrepreneur etc. The time spent at 
IITK was amazing and I would love to go back and play at that basketball court again.


# Johns Hopkins University

I came to Baltimore, US in August 2017. This was the first time; I ever came outside India. I was feeling exited 
as well as nervous about the new country/opportunity. But, I was fortunate enough to make amazing friend and explore 
the city of Baltimore. Life as a graduate student at Hopkins was going well until Feb 2020, as pandemic hits everyone 
and everything comes to a halt. But, now after few years, I am looking to completing my Ph.D. and looking forward to new 
opportunities in life.
